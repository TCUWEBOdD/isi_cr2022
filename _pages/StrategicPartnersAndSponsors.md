In a society where the amount of information is growing explosively, free access to reliable and integral data is crucial. As the national statistical office, [Statistics Netherlands (CBS)](https://www.cbs.nl/en-gb) provides reliable statistical information and data to produce insight into social issues, thus supporting the public debate, policy development and decision-making while contributing to prosperity, well-being and democracy. CBS was established in 1899 in response to the need for independent and reliable information that advances the understanding of social issues. This is still the main role of CBS. Through time, CBS has grown into an innovative knowledge institution, with continuous adoption of new technologies and developments in order to safeguard the quality of its data and its independent position.

[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)’s mission is to create free and open-source software for data science, scientific research, and technical communication. We do this to enhance the production and consumption of knowledge by everyone, regardless of economic means, and to facilitate collaboration and reproducible research, both of which are critical to the integrity and efficacy of work in science, education, government, and industry.
RStudio also produces RStudio Team, a modular platform of commercial software products that give organizations the confidence to adopt R, Python and other open-source data science software at scale - for the benefit of many people, to leverage large amounts of data, to integrate with existing enterprise systems, platforms, and processes, or be compliant with security practices and standards - along with online services to make it easier to learn and use them over the web.
Together, RStudio’s open-source software and commercial software form a virtuous cycle: The adoption of open-source data science software at scale in organizations creates demand for RStudio’s commercial software; and the revenue from commercial software, in turn, enables deeper investment in the open-source software that benefits everyone.
