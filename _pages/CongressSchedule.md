## Congress Schedule

See our Programme-at-a-glance and check back regularly for updates. The programme schedule currently covers the confirmed LIVE sessions and ceremonies. Mark you calendars!

General 
The Scientific Programme of the WSC is developed with the diverse interests of the ISI members and the international community in mind. The Programme includes lnvited Paper Sessions (IPS) and Contributed Paper/Poster Sessions (CPS). There will no longer be Special Topic Sessions (STS) at the Virtual WSC.

Invited Paper Sessions (IPS)
The IPSs are developed by the Scientific Programme Committee (SPC) of the ISI and its Associations. IPSs usually consist of 3-4 presenters and a discussant invited by the organiser of the session.

The SPC reviews the proposals and selects the IPSs to be included in the ISI WSCs with due consideration to the diversity of topics, the regional distribution of organisers, scientific quality and impacts.
