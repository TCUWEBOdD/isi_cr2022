## Scientific Programme FAQ

1. Will registration fees be waived for invited speakers? Do I have to be a member of the ISI or one of its Associations?
All speakers have to pay registration fees. You do not have to have an active membership in the ISI and its Associations; however, we have reduced rates for our members. Please also see questions and answers 1 and 2 above.
2. Where can I find information on the scientific programme and guidelines for session organisers?
The most recent information on the scientific programme/congress schedule is available on the website. Guidelines for contributed papers/posters are available.
3. If my abstract is selected, how will I make my presentation?
Once you are selected as a speaker in the virtual WSC 2021, you will receive instructions on how to prepare your presentation in May. Most presentations will be pre-recorded and some will be live. You will have support from us for making your presentation in either format, also during the event.
4. I am a session organiser and need to make changes to the description or speakers/discussants in my session (speakers and titles of talks) but cannot gain access.
The systems for the session proposals and the abstract/paper submissions are now closed. 
5. I forgot my password, what should I do?
The ‘reset password’ function works for both systems. If you have an account and press password reset, you will receive an e-mail. Check your spam folder for this e-mail or ask your IT administrator to put e-mails from EventsAIR on the safe list.
6. I have submitted a proposal for a 90 minute session but have been allocated a 60 minute session. With three speakers and a discussant I need a 90 minute session, can my request be granted?
All 90 minute slots have been allocated and none are available. Try to arrange the session within the format and time allotted to it.
7. I am a session organiser and would like to have access to the abstracts and papers submitted by the speaker in the session I organised. How do I get access?
Currently it is not possible for you to have direct access. Please ask your speakers your send you the abstracts/papers directly.
8. Where can I upload my abstract and paper?
The deadline has passed and the system is now closed.
